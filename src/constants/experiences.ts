        description: "I participated in the development of the video game Kertin's Fate directed by Fausto Zamora using the Godot game engine, where I developed the save system that allows to save the progress at any time and load it later from the main menu or pause, implemented an entire level with its respective final boss including its behavior and attack mechanics, created the behavior of an enemy that interacts with the player taking his life and making him a “knockback” effect, introduced the pause system that allows players to pause the game at any time and resume it later.",
